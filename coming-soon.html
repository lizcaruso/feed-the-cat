        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Let's Feed the Cat is a simple web-based game where you can feed a stray cat.</p>
        <p>It was designed and developed by cat mom to Pesto and Ravioli (and overall cat enthusiast) Liz Caruso for the final project in General Assembly's Front End Development Part-Time Course.</p>
        <p>It utilizes a combination of skills developed in this course, ranging from HTML, responsive CSS Styling, and  Javascript.</p>
        <p>Illustrations are by Cute Little Workshop, and you can find their work on Creative Market or at their personal website.</p>
